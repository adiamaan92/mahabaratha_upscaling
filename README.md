# Upscaling Giampaolo Tomasetti's Mahabaratha paintings.
Giampaolo Tomasettiâ€™s is a co-founder and a member of the International Academy of Vedic Art. He studied Mahabaratha for 5 years and took 12 years to complete his collection of 25 majestic paintings depicting the main moments of the Mahabharata.
If you are interested in Mahabaratha and Art, I highly recommend reading <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28574720-mahabharata>Mahabarata by Giampaolo Tomasetti </a>. The book details the backstory for each of the paintings and how it came about.

This is an attempt to upscale these images using SRCNN and <a href='https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x'>Waifu 2x</a> in particular.
